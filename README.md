Udacity Front End Nanodegree Arcade Game Clone
===============================

## How to Play
Download this repository, and run the index.html file.
You can also play online here: https://tirabee.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/

## Game Rules
Similar to Frogger, you must move your character across the road without getting hit by any bugs. If you do get hit, your position will be reset so you can try again!

## Credits
